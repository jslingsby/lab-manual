We aim to make our methods and results available so that they can be reused, reanalyzed, learnt from and built on. As a general guide to what this means, check out our course notes. Specifics of how this is implemented in the lab are detailed below.\nSee the next chapter for more detail on our lab culture and philosophy. We are motivated heavily by the following two papers - which provide a blueprint for how we think about the way we do our work:"

Nasty comments are not welcome, but we also don’t beat around the bush if tere are issues to be raised.\nThis resource from UBC does a really great job of outlining the main points of how to give and receive feedback."

    "text": "2.3 The care and maintenance of Jasper\n\n“Maintaining your adviser means asking for what you need rather than hoping [they] will know what to provide.” - Kearns and Gardiner (2011)\n\nPlease, please, please, take five minutes to read the Kearns and Gardiner commentary at the link above!\nBeyond that, here are 3 additional points to be aware of:\n\nAs Dr Seuss says “Unslumping yourself is not easily done.” While there are suspicions among the lab members, Jasper professes that he cannot read your mind. This means that he can’t possibly know what you need or when you’re stuck. The consequence is that you may have to be stuck for an unnecessarily long time before he notices, which can put you behind schedule and risk you failing to complete the degree in time. You do have one easy first step - tell Jasper! He’ll do whatever he can to help, even if this means passing you onto someone else or applying tough love.\n“You lead your projects. You don’t work for Jasper. Jasper works with you on your projects.” (to paraphrase (Markowetz 2015a)). Your degree or postdoc is aimed at your professional development. The more responsibility you take, the more you’ll get out of it. While Jasper may have provided he idea and funding, once he’s handed you the project you are the leader, his role is to help keep you on track. While there may be some tension between you taking leadership and avoiding getting stuck in a slump (point 1), open communication with Jasper will help you find the happy balance.\nYour adviser does not have to be your only mentor! There are many paths in academia and related careers, and many different personalities. Your adviser cannot provide everything! That said, they do have good networks and can probably help you find additional mentors to help address your specific needs, be they related to science, personal interests, race, gender, sexuality, etc."

    "section": "2.4 How we share things",
    "text": "2.4 How we share things\nWe have standard ways of sharing things. These don’t always have to be followed but are a useful guide and will make things easier. When sending material to someone, always make sure to describe what you are sending and try to make it as easy as possible for them to help you.\nTaking a project-based approach to organizing your work makes it easier to share and solicit feedback from others, as things tend to be self-contained. Try to keep only 1 working instance of material, and use some form of version control to facilitate this (see recommendations in Wilson et. al paper linked above).\nProject management tools in Github are a good way to record and document questions on analyses. Use ‘Issues’ on github repositories for project-related tasks and problems. Alternatively, make use of a Google Doc for each project to record this history, much like you would a lab notebook.\nCode: is shared via Github repositories. If you’re not familiar with Github when joining the lab, this will be part of your Onboarding. For specific questions on problems, please try to create a minimal reproducible example. Ensure that others can run and interact with the material being shared. We mostly work in R, but there are always exceptions.\nWriting: Preferably via Google Doc, R Markdown/Quarto (shared via a Github repository), or Overleaf. If it is a thesis chapter that you want feedback on, please also share it with Jasper as a PDF. Documents should always have your last name as the first part of the file name (e.g. please no “mythesis.doc”).\nData: A copy of your raw data must be kept in your Google Drive folder shared with you by Jasper. All data analysis need to start with these raw data files, although you can create intermediate “clean” data files or objects by running a data cleaning script.\nWe [may] also share our institutional knowledge through a lab-chat github ‘issues’ repository. This would be a community-driven troubleshooting resource. Jasper will look into settng this up.\nWe maintain a Google Drive folder for lab publications, presentations, photos, CVs, etc. Please make use of these so that others in the lab can make fair use of our work."

    "text": "Ask for help, and share our learning\nMake ourselves available\nCome prepared and engage\nPlan with intention, and follow through\nCelebrate accomplishments (ours & those of others)\nAcknowledge and give credit to other lab member’s work\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community\nAre mindful of our own biases - and agree to avoid being defensive when our unconscious biases are pointed out to us\nPractice radical candor\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration\n\nThough we do not expect incoming members to memorize everything, we do expect members to be aware of the group’s values.\nAsk for help, and share your learning: We are all learners, and most of our learning is done from each other. It is inefficient to struggle through problems alone. Ask for and give assistance with appropriate cognizance of the value of your time and the time of the person you are asking. You are not the first or last person to encounter a problem. When you identify a problem add an issue to the lab issues repository, and update it with solutions when it is resolved. We can also consider adding it to the lab manual, writing a tutorial/blog post for lab’s web page, and share with the larger community by tweeting, leading and sharing at a lab meeting, or running a workshop.\nMake yourself available: Be responsive to communication, and make time for things that address longer term goals, even when busy. For example, do not skip on things like attending seminars just because you have a big deadline looming (see note below on planning and organization). Note that being available does not mean that you are available 24/7 - this is not expected. Because as a group we value the role of collaboration and interaction in improving our work, it is expected that you be available in the lab/office during normal business hours for some time during the week (see section on attendance expectations).\nCome prepared and be engaged: Value your time. Be present during lab and individual meetings, and come to your work ready to do your work. Contribute and participate in planning and lab discussions. When it is your turn to run a meeting, come with an agenda and be prepared with questions. Aim to view meetings as events that contribute to your work and productivity, rather than taking away from them.\nCelebrate accomplishments (yours & others): You and your colleagues work hard. Things don’t always go exactly as you plan. Be supportive and proud of yourself and your peers when you accomplish things. We are not competing with each other - someone else’s success does not mean your failure. Share your accomplishments with others!\nSustain a positive, safe learning environment: Everyone learns something for the first time at some time, and people learn in different ways. Expressing that you don’t know something is OK, and we understand that this can make someone feel vulnerable. We strive to maintain a culture that allows for and encourages this vulnerability. Community members should not be disparaged for not knowing things, and in addition, should not be disparaged for knowing things or wanting to learn.\nHave an interdisciplinary (open) mindset: We apply our work at the science-policy interface. This means we work on problems that span multiple disciplines. Co-creation of knowledge requires transdisciplinary approaches that can result in solutions that would not be possible with siloing. You will be collaborating with others who have different types of expertise, values, and terminology. Trust the expertise of others and actively seek feedback recognizing the importance of specialization.\nBe mindful and aware of your own biases: We all have biases that are inherent and can not be removed, but we can still work on both being less biased, and more aware of bias in ourselves and others. Periodically check in on your biases.\nPlan with intention, and follow through: Be organized and adaptable. Things don’t always go as planned and that’s OK. Planning can help you adapt when they don’t (see Come Prepared). Find a program/project management approach that works for you (see “How we work”); being organized can reduce stress immensely and help you progress with your goals.\nFoster inclusivity within our group and greater community: Part of our lab culture is that we are good citizens of our community, we take on leadership roles within SMAST and the University, we are supportive of others in our community during their milestones, we actively participate in SMAST events (e.g. the IMS graduate research symposium) and perform outreach. Work with Gavin when crafting your individual mentoring/development plans (see Chapter on Onboarding) to identify what you want to aim your efforts at.\nPromote and sustain healthy work-life integration: Our scientific research is not the only important thing in our lives, and publishing research is not the only mechanism by which to provide science and support our communities. We recognize the importance of our other commitments in keeping us healthy (mentally and physically) and bring our whole selves to our efforts. Try not to normalize overwork or being busy as achievement or status.\nPractice radical candor: We care personally while also challenging directly. Be honest when communicating, accept critical (but kind) feedback, and give the same to others. View relationships within the group as collaborative rather than evaluative. Don’t take constructive criticism personally.\nAcknowledge and give credit: Working as part of a team, we will often (always?) be building on work done by others, receive assistance with work (see “Ask for help”), and using others’ words, code, content. Include acknowledgement and give credit for those contributions, in all forms of communication. We share content and code within the group with this expectation. One easy approach is to include hyperlinks to the work of others or their social media in your work. This also helps to amplify their voice and work as well as yours."

The goal is to create an open and inclusive space for our work that helps us achieve our collective goals.

    "text": "4.1 Short version\nWe’re dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form and prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort.\nThe University’s policies and guidelines provide the framework governing the dos, don’ts and consequences for severe infringements. Our lab policy is aimed at reducing the occurrence of subtler forms of discrimination, often as the result of unconscious bias, hoping to actively improve ourselves, our lab and our society. For the most part we do this by having regular open courageous conversations about diversity, equity and inclusion in the lab and society, envisioning what we would like to have and what we need to do to get there. We’re also experimenting with ways to create a safe space for calling out incidents of unconscious bias to help us all be more aware of and address our biases and their impacts on others.\nHarassment includes:\n\nOffensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion.\n\nUnwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.\nDeliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names.\nGratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behaviour in spaces where they’re not appropriate.\nPhysical contact and simulated physical contact (eg, textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.\nThreats of violence.\nIncitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm.\nDeliberate intimidation.\nStalking or following.\nHarassing photography or recording, including logging online activity for harassment purposes.\nSustained disruption of discussion.\nUnwelcome sexual attention.\nPattern of inappropriate social contact, such as requesting/assuming inappropriate levels of intimacy with others\nContinued one-on-one communication after requests to cease.\nDeliberate “outing” of any aspect of a person’s identity without their consent except as necessary to protect vulnerable people from intentional abuse.\nPublication of non-harassing private communication.\n\n\n4.1.1 Reporting\nIf you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the PI, Dr. Gavin Fay, at gfay@umassd.edu. If you do not wish to contact Dr. Fay, please contact Department Chair Dr. Steve Cadrin scadrin@umassd.edu and/or SMAST Assistant Dean Mike Marino mmarino@umassd.edu. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.\nLab members who believe they have been subjected to any kind of discrimination that conflicts with the University of Massachusetts’ policies and/or the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts’ should seek assistance from a supervisor or an HR representative. Information about the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth’s Equal Opportunity and Anti-Harassment policies, complaint procedures and form.\nConfidentiality: Please remember that by way of his position at the university, Dr. Fay is a mandated reporter under Title IX. This means that he is not allowed to keep matters falling under Title IX confidential, and is required to disclose these incidents to the administration. You are welcome to discuss matters with Dr. Fay, but please keep this in mind when doing so. Gavin will do his best to remind you of his responsibilities at the start of conversations anticipated to relate to these topics. If you would prefer to discuss incidents of harassment that fall under Title IX with a confidential source, you can contact David Gomes, UMass Dartmouth Director of Diversity and Inclusion.\nThis code of conduct applies to Fay lab spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the Fay lab or another member of the SMAST community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by Fay lab members seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time. The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the Fay lab based on their past behavior, including behavior outside Fay lab spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the Fay lab. The University Counseling Center provides a range of services to help students develop improved coping skills to address emotional, interpersonal and academic concerns.\nTo protect our team members from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.\nThe above caveats noted, we will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse when possible. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of the Fay lab members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.\n\n\n4.1.2 Consequences\nParticipants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.\nIf a participant engages in harassing behavior, Dr. Fay may take any action they deem appropriate, which includes referral to the Department Chair and Dean’s Office under the SMAST policy, and also including expulsion from all Fay lab spaces.\n\n\n4.1.3 Additional resources\nOther University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees and University documents:\n\nPolicy Against Intolerance\nPrinciples of Employee Conduct\nResolution in Support of Pluralism\nNon-Discrimination and Harassment Policy\nStatement of Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity\nStatement on Cultural Diversity and Inclusion\nStatement on Gender Discrimination\nBully, Harassment and Violence\nStudent Conduct Policies and Procedures\nSexual Harassment Policy\nTitle IX and Sexual Assault/Harassment"
